# Weather Bot
 Discord Bot to respond weather information in a channel


Requirements:
	DiscordJS, dark-sky, Youtube API access, axios.

The API keys for dark-sky and Youtube can be hard coded, if you want.
I recommend them being in a separate file. 


Bot can display weather information using a Discoed Embeded response.
